_TaskTrek: A Student Workspace & Well-being Planner_

**Problem**: 
Students often face issues with sitting down and working on homework, whether itâ€™s due to short attention span, inability to prioritize tasks, or sheer boredom and lack of interest. Additionally, students often forgot to take care of themselves when dealing with busy schedules and stress. This impacts all aspects of physical health (from sleep, eating and exercise habits, etc.). 

**Solution**: 
Our application seeks to help solve the reluctance that students face when it comes to completing assignments. We aim to create a fun and rewarding experience for completing tasks as well as an interface with tools that can help with focus. On the health side, we want to provide a way for students to maintain healthy habits (tracking sleep, getting enough steps, outside time) and resources they can consult (finding workouts, healthy meals, etc.)

**Key Features**: 
- Weekly planner interface
- To-do list with physical representation when you complete something
- Pomodoro timer
- Achievement completion and reward system
- Motivational quotes
- Daily tracker for healthy habits (sleep, water, steps, exercise, reading time) 
- Resources for finding healthy recipes & different workouts
  
**Why this Project?**
As students for several years ourselves, we hope to create a project that we ourselves would use in order to tackle the projects and homework that we have and maintain healthy habits along the way. It can be really difficult to work in a timely manner and be motivated enough to get tasks done as well as keep yourself on a healthy regimen, so students all over should have a platform that helps them overcome these issues to decrease their stress.
