**🎓🧘‍♂️ TaskTrek: A Smart Planner for Student Success & Well-Being**

**Problem**: 
Students often struggle to sit down and complete homework—whether due to short attention spans, difficulty prioritizing tasks, or a lack of motivation and interest. Additionally, when overwhelmed by busy schedules and stress, students tend to neglect self-care. This can negatively impact physical health, including sleep, nutrition, and exercise habits.

**Solution**: 
Our application aims to addresses the reluctance students face when completing assignments by creating a fun, rewarding, and focused work environment. We aim to support academic productivity with tools that boost focus and engagement, while also encouraging healthy lifestyle habits—especially sleep. The platform will also offer resources for workouts, healthy meals, and overall wellness.

**Key Features**: 
- Weekly planner interface
- To-do list with visual feedback for task completion
- Pomodoro timer
- Achievement tracking and reward system
- Daily habit tracker to promote well-being
  
**Why this Project?**
As students ourselves, we wanted to build something we would genuinely use—an app to help us stay on top of coursework while maintaining healthy habits. Balancing motivation, deadlines, and self-care is a challenge for students everywhere. TaskTrek aims to reduce stress and empower users to stay productive and priortize their wellbeing.
